                <br> 
                We put things on the internet for various reasons ranging from one's whims, to the desire to help one another, or to become famous. Some post to hurt others and some people post to promote what they either care about or have been paid to do so. In truth there are theoretically as mansy reaons for putting something on the web as there are users. That means there is no single answer to this question.

                <br> 
                Theoretically innovtion will make eveything in the present day obsolete eventully. That is unless some how the human population was eradicated within the next couple years halting the progression of technology.
