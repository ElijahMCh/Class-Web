                <p>One day in the dead of winter the two came face to face and pulled their gun on the other, however before one could shoot a loud CRACK echoed through the forest and a large tree fell. Both men tried to avoid it, but both found themselves pinned under the tree. There they yelled for their men waiting for their rescue and their enemy's death.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>Time passed and no one had come. Ulrick von Gradwitz used what strength he had to grab a flask of wine from in his inner breast pocket. He paused for a moment and looked over at George Znaeym. Should he offer peace with the man he hated or should he drink it all himself?</p>
