                <h3><u><highlight>Book Synonymous</highlight></u></h3>
                <p>Hobbits, a race of small humanlike creatures, characteristically value peace, simplicity, and cozy homes yet are capable of incredible feats of courage and resourcefulness. The unwilling hero of The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, is persuaded to join Thorin and his 12 dwarfs to recover their stolen treasure, which is being guarded by the dragon Smaug. During the expedition, Bilbo finds a magical ring that renders the wearer invisible, which figures prominently in The Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is the story of Bilbo's maturing from a seeker of warmth and comforts to a fighter, however humble, for the greater good.

                <h3><u>Themes</u></h3>
                <p>The story of Bilbo's journey has many strong themes that can be felt throughout. Those most noticeable are the themes of Greed, Home and Birthright, Heroism, and the Power of Language. 
                <p>Greed can be felt throughout the book especially when looking at the antagonist Smaug, a dragon embodying the essence of greed. The king's jewel and the Misty Mountain as a whole also represent endless wealth that nations go to war for. It is only through great loyalty that Bilbo is able to resist the allure of the mountains of gold. It is the small ct of the individual who takes what they need and nothing more that Bilbo embodies and makes him immune to the dragon sickness.</p>
                <p>Home and Birthright can also be seen in the story in ties with the Misty Mountain and Thorin who by birthright feels that the mountain and its treasures belong to him and his kin. It is also what leads Thranduil to abandon the dwarves to the dragon. It is his belief that certain jewels that the dwarves have belong to him but as he was denied he refused to aid the dwarves in their time of need.</p>
            <img class="m2" src="images/Map.jpg" alt="Mao of the Misty Mountain">
                <p>Heroism is also a very present theme as the book's protagonist learns what it means to be a hero. Bilbo leaves the comfort of his home and journeys to a mountain where he willingly steals from a dragon. He braves hardships throughout his journey there and the following war after the death of Smaug. He leans to not shy away from danger and to do what is right, not what is expected.</p>
                <p>Power of Language is another strong theme due to the incapability of the protagonist, Bilbo. He is not a warrior and has no fighting experience yet he is able to get the part and himself out of danger constantly due to his tongue. That is to say he learns the importance of language and how one can use it to stall, sow discord, and to distract. It is the main skill that Bilbo relies aon during his adventure and is his most skilled ability.</p>

                <img class="m3" src="images/Bilbo.jpg" alt="Bilbo Baggins">
                <p><u>Bilbo Baggins</u></p>
                <p>The hero of the story. Bilbo is a hobbit, "a short, human-like person." Commonsensical and fastidious, Bilbo leads a quiet life in his comfortable hole at Bag End and, like most hobbits, is content to stay at home. But Bilbo possesses a great deal of untapped inner strength, and when the wizard Gandalf persuades Bilbo to join a group of dwarves on a quest to reclaim their gold from a marauding dragon, Bilbo ends up playing a crucial role as the company's burglar. Bilbo's adventures awaken his courage and initiative and prove his relentless ability to do what needs to be done.</p>

                <p><u>Gandalf the Grey</u></p>
            <img class="m4" src="images/Gandalf.jpg" alt="Gandalf the Grey">
                <p>A wise old wizard who always seems to know more than he reveals. Gandalf has a vast command of magic and tends to show up at just the moment he is needed most. Though he helps the dwarves in their quest (not least by making Bilbo go along with them), he does not seem to have any interest in their gold. He always has another purpose or plan in mind, but he rarely reveals his private thoughts.</p>

                <p><u>Thorin Oakenshield</u></p>
                <p>A dwarf who leads his fellow dwarves on a trip to the Lonely Mountain to reclaim their treasure from Smaug. Smaug's bounty is Thorin's inheritance, as it belonged to Thror, Thorin's grandfather, the great King under the Mountain. Thorin is a proud, purposeful, and sturdy warrior, if a bit stubborn at times. As the novel progresses, his inability to formulate successful plans, his greed, and his reliance on Bilbo to save him at every turn make Thorin a somewhat unappealing figure, but he is partly redeemed by the remorse he shows before he dies.</p>
